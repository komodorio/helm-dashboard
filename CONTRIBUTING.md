# Contributing to Helm Dashboard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## First-time contributors

We've tagged some issues to make it easy to get started :smile:
[Good first issues](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard/labels/good%20first%20issue)

Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard/issues/new) and labeling it with the `bug` label. It's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

# Reset Cache
The "Reset Cache" feature in Helm Dashboard clears the cached data and fetches the latest information from the backend or data source. It ensures that the dashboard displays up-to-date data and reflects any recent changes or updates.

# Installed Releases list
A release is an instance of your selected chart running on your Kubernetes Cluster. That means every time that you install a Helm chart there, it creates a new release or instance that coexists with other releases without conflict. You can filter releases based on namespaces or search for release names

The squares represent k8s resources installed by the release. Hover over each square to view a tooltip with details. Yellow indicates "pending," green signifies a healthy state, and red indicates an unhealthy state.

Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters â€” they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other.

Updated" refers to the amount of time that has passed since the last revision of the release. Whenever you install or upgrade the release, a new revision is created. You can think of it as the "age" of the latest revision.
